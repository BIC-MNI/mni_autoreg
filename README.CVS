If you have just checked the sources out of CVS, you will discover several
files are missing, most notably the configure script.

To regenerate the missing files, run the provided shell script:

	./autogen.sh

You will need reasonably recent versions of autoconf and automake.

This step needs only be done once.  Rules in the Makefiles will keep
all the generated files up-to-date when files are edited.
