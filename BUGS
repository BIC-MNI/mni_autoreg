Older Bug Notes (not sure if these still apply)

* On DEC Alpha systems (at least those running OSF), "make test" fails
  due to a floating point exception in mincblur.  This is actually
  a problem in the Volume_io library that underlies all of the C programs
  in the package, but the exception just happens to occur when writing
  out the blurred version of the particular data used in the test suite.
  The problem code has been isolated and will soon be fixed, but this
  will require upgrading Volume_io (or MINC, which packages a copy of
  Volume_io) rather than MNI_AutoReg.

* There may be other floating point exceptions lurking in the code
  that will only be found on systems less forgiving than IRIX and
  Solaris (our development and test platforms).  Users of such systems
  are kindly asked to report any exceptions to us!
