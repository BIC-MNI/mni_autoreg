  Montreal Neurological Institute Automated Linear Registration Package

This is a list of frequently asked questions regarding the MNI_AutoReg
package.

Questions:
	1- How do I get my data into MINC format?
        2- How do I view the results of the registration?
	3- How do I customize objective functions used for fitting?
	4- How do I customize the optimization procedure used?

	6- How do I report bugs?

1- HOW DO I GET MY DATA INTO MINC FORMAT?

   The simplest way is with rawtominc, one of the utilities
   distributed with the MINC package.  If you can extract just the raw
   images from some data file (e.g. your scanner's native format),
   then rawtominc can turn it into a MINC file.  Note that you must
   know at *least* the volume size, orientation (transverse, coronal,
   or sagittal) and voxel size in all three dimensions to create a
   MINC file that can be used for registration or display purposes.
   See the rawtominc man page for more details.

2- HOW DO I VIEW THE RESULTS OF THE REGISTRATION?

   When you run mritotal, the result is not a new image volume
   containing the input MRI in Talairach space.  Rather, mritotal
   outputs a "transform file", which simply contains a homogeneous
   transformation matrix that transforms points in native (MRI) space
   to Talairach space.  Note that these points and transforms are
   specified as world coordinates, so are invariant across simple
   operations done on the volumes (such as resampling, reshaping,
   zero-padding, or removing data).  If you wish to see the registered
   data, you need to first apply the coordinate transform to the
   native MRI data.  This is done with mincresample, one of the core
   programs of the MINC package.  In this case, mincresample requires
   that you specify both a transform file (as output by mritotal) and
   a sampling grid.  For example, say you have just registered the MRI
   volume smith_john_mri.mnc with the command

      mritotal smith_john_mri.mnc smith_john_mrital.xfm

   creating the transform file smith_john_mrital.xfm.  You now need to
   apply the transform file *and* specify the sampling grid.  The
   transform file is specified with mincresample's "-transformation"
   option.  There are a variety of ways to specify the sampling grid,
   but the easiest way to specify the sampling grid is with the
   "-like" option, which simply tells mincresample to reuse the
   sampling grid of another MINC volume.  (You can also explicitly
   specify all the start coordinates, voxel step sizes, dimension
   lengths, and direction cosines of the sampling axes.)  For example,
   if you have installed the MNI_AutoReg model files in
   /usr/local/bic/share/mni-models, you could use the 
   average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc file there as a resampling model with 
   the following command:

      mincresample smith_john_mri.mnc smith_john_mrital.mnc \
         -transform smith_john_mrital.xfm \
         -like /usr/local/bic/share/mni-models/average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc

   This works by taking every voxel in average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc, transforming
   it's (x,y,z) coordinates *back* to native space using the inverse
   of the specified transformation, and sampling the native MRI data
   there (using trilinear interpolation).  For more information, see
   the mincresample man page.

   Next, you'll want to look at the resampled MRI data, preferably
   alongside the registration model (average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc).  You can
   obtain Register (in precompiled form) from packages.mni.mcgill.ca
   When you have Register installed on your system, try the following 
   command (assuming you have already done the above resampling):

   register /usr/local/bic/share/mni-models/average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc smith_john_mrital.mnc


2- HOW DO I CUSTOMIZE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS USED FOR FITTING?
3- HOW DO I CUSTOMIZE THE OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE USED?

   Customization of the fitting program is possible by modifying the source
   files for minctracc.  Notes for adding new objective functions or new
   optimization procedures can be found in Doc/howto_add_obj_fn and
   Doc/howto_add_opt_fn, repectively.

4- HOW DO I BUILD A NEW TARGET MODEL FOR REGISTRATION?

   The default model used with the MNI AutoReg package is is based on
   the 305 brain average MRI volume created at the Montreal Neurological
   Institute.  (This model is *not* included with the MNI AutoReg
   package, but is available at

      http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz

   Look for mni_autoreg_model-XXX.tar.gz, or possibly a more recent
   version.  There are four steps to use a new model file: you have to
   build the features volumes, construct a brain mask, install the
   model, and tell mritotal to use the new model.

   1 - Building the feature volumes:

   This package (mni_autoreg) installs a script called `make_model' that
   contains the commands required to build the feature volumes for the
   stereotaxic model.  Your input volume must be in Talairach space, and
   should have a simple name that will identify the model: for example,
   the input volume supplied with the model package is
   "average305_t1_tal_lin.mnc".  Run make_model with the *base* name of your input
   volume, eg. "make_model average305_t1_tal_lin".  This will then perform the
   necessary processing to make a set of feature volumes (16mm intensity
   blur, 8mm intensity and gradient blurs) needed for fitting with
   mritotal.

   2 - Mask creation:

   It is also necessary to have two mask volumes.  

   One is a mask of all the voxels in the head.  This must be named 
   <BASE>_headmask.mnc, with <BASE> replaced by the base name of your model.
   For example, the MNI's model package contains average305_t1_tal_lin_headmask.mnc.

   The second mask is a mask of all voxels in the brain.  This must be
   named <BASE>_mask.mnc; e.g. the file average305_t1_tal_lin_mask.mnc included
   with the model package.  This particular mask was created
   semi-automatically using the interactive program Display;
   presumably, other 3-D volume display/manipulation programs have
   similar capabilities.  (Display is also available from the MNI, but
   currently for SGI workstations only.  Contact the author, David
   MacDonald <david@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>, for more information.)

   3 - Installation:

   You should then install the input volume (<base>.mnc), feature volumes
   (<base>_16_blur.mnc, <base>_8_blur.mnc, <base>_8_dxyz.mnc), and mask
   volume (<base>_mask.mnc) in your system model directory.

   4 - mritotal:

   There are two ways to use the new model.  The first is to run 

	mritotal -modeldir /foo/bar/baz -model <BASE> subject.mnc subject.xfm

   where /foo/bar/baz is the directory in which the new model files
   were installed.  In fact, `modeldir /foo/bar/baz' is unnecessary
   if you installed the model files into the default model directory.
   You can check the default model directory using `mritotal -help'.

   The second is to make a copy of mritotal.cfg in your home directory and
   replace the -modeldir and -model options with the directory and
   base name of your model, respectively.  Mritotal will read your
   personal mritotal.cfg, and use the new model by default.
 
5- HOW DO I REPORT BUGS?

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making MNI AutoReg
   reliable by making the next version of MNI AutoReg work better.  Any
   unexpected, anomalous, weird, or just plain wrong behaviour should be
   reported to Louis Collins <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>.
