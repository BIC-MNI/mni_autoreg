The program minctracc was developed by Louis Collins under the direction of
Dr. Alan Evans and Dr. Terry Peters at the NeuroImaging Laboratory at the
Montreal Neurological Institute.  All Perl scripts were developed by Greg
Ward; mritotal is an all-new version of Louis Collins' mritotal script,
emboding pretty much the same algorithm, but rewritten almost entirely from
scratch.  The MINC library was developed by Peter Neelin.  The Volume_io
library was developed by David MacDonald.
