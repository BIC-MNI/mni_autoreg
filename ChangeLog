	* many changes (many) for a clean minc 2.0 build

2006-06-04  Andrew L Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>

	* Added masking for feature volumes from Patricia Le Nezet & Irina Kezele

2005-01-29  Andrew Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>
	* removed #include <malloc.h> from mincblur build to assist OSX build

2004-03-18  Andrew Janke <rotor@cmr.uq.edu.au>
	* changed make_model from csh to sh (Cygwin has no csh by default)

2004-02-08  Andrew Janke <rotor@cmr.uq.edu.au>
	* removed all the public/private syntatic sugar (private->static)
	* Added use of FindBin::Bin to perl progs for libs, data and config
	    the old method failed with binary distributions with a prefix

2004-02-04  patricia Le Nezet <lenezet@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* fixed direction cosines problems

2002-03-26  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
	* configure.in: Updated to conform to autoconf 2.5x.  Use the BIC
	standard macros in directory m4; these need to be checked out from
	repository 'mni-acmacros'.

	* acinclude.m4: Removed.

	* autogen.sh: Invoke aclocal with "-I m4" option.	

	* Makefile.am: Invoke aclocal with "-I m4" option.  Distribute
	the m4/*.m4 files.

	* Globally replace include of <internal_volume_io.h> by
	<volume_io/internal_volume_io.h> to match practice of MINC 0.7.

2001-02-16  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* configure.in: Set VERSION to 0.98k.

2001-01-28  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
	* INSTALL.quick: Updated to account for changes to configure.

2001-01-25  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
	* configure.in: Do not automatically add lib and include
	directories from /usr/local and ${prefix}.  Add configure flag
	--with-build-path to allow specifying extra locations for the
	compiler to look.
	Set VERSION to 0.98j.

2000-05-19  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* autogen.sh: run `autoheader' before `automake'.  In order for
 	the autoheader-generated file `config.h.in' to appear in the
 	distribution list, it must exist before `automake' is run.

2000-05-12  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (ellipse4.mnc): make sure we look
	in $(srcdir) for tps.xfm.

	* INSTALL.quick: point to README.CVS.

	* README: note current version; add pointers to INSTALL.quick and
 	INSTALL.

2000-05-11  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* AUTHORS (contact): changed the contact list to include Steve and
	  myself.

	* README:  added reference to the nonlinear registration procedure

	* COPYING: added reference to the nonlinear registration procedure

2000-04-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: consistently quote variables in `test "$var" = val'
	constructs to avoid the shell error in the case that the variable
	value has spaces or is the null string.

2000-04-06  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (check_DATA): use to specify the auxiliary
	data files needed for `make check' rather than having the tests
	depend on the data files.  This ensures the data files are ONLY
	built if `make check' is run, and not built for, e.g. `make dist'.

2000-04-05  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* BUGS: remove note about minctracc/Optimize/super_sample_def.c

	* configure.in: set VERSION to 0.98i.

2000-03-26  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* tagged as release-0_98h.

2000-03-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* BUGS, FAQ, INSTALL.quick, ORIGIN, README, TESTING: minor
 	updates, such as replacing Greg by Louis, changing version
 	numbers, dates, etc.

	* make_model.in: new.  Renamed from make_model; generated so that
	proper version information can be included.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): distribute make_model.in rather than built
	script.  Drop OTHER_INFO; this info is folded into README.

2000-02-28  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: check for headers math.h and stdlib.h, since we
	test for their existence in acconfig.h!

2000-02-24  Steve Robbins  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): add make_model.

	* make_model: new.  Generates requisite model files by blurring
	and subsampling a given volume.

	* configure.in (MNI_CPPFLAGS, MNI_LDFLAGS): maintain $prefix
	before /usr/local.  Remove the checks for -lc, and -lsun, since no
	code is using the function xdr_long.  Remove checks for -lc_s and
	-lucb; these libraries also seem superfluous.

2000-02-24  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* acinclude.m4: new version; concatenation of smr.m4 and
	ac_help_string.m4 from smr_macros-0.2.2.

2000-02-20  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* */Makefile.am: 
	* configure.in: remove INCLUDEDIRS and LIBDIRS in favour of
	MNI_LIBS and MNI_INCLUDES.

2000-02-19  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): clean the log files.

	* Proglib/Proglib.h: don't include vax_conversions.h.

	* Proglib/Makefile.am (libProglib_a_SOURCES): removed
	vax_conversions.[ch]; add history.[ch].

	* Proglib/history.[ch]: new.  Create a history string consisting
	of the time_stamp, _plus_ the long version string.

	* configure.in (MNI_INCLUDES, MNI_LIBS): use these variables,
	rather than CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  The latter must be
	user-settable at build time.  Fail if a probed-for library
	function is not found.

2000-02-16  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: remove check of volume_io version using RCS id.

	* mincchamfer: new.  Copied from Louis' home directory.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): add mincchamfer.

	* Testing/Makefile.am (TESTS): Nonlinear mode does not work well
	to recover large affine transformations; so use only test2.xfm,
	the equivalent to the old `animal.test'.
	(test1.xfm): z-translate by 30 rather than 50 to keep ellipse
	inside volume.

2000-02-16  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (TESTS): split `minctracc-linear' test
	into three linear-{1,2,3}, add corresponding nonlinear-1 test (with 
	more to come).  Add rules to create ellipse?_dxyz files.

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): add check-news, to enforce
 	updated NEWS file when making a release.

2000-02-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (TESTS): new set of automated tests; try
	to recover a known (linear) transformation, with some tolerance for
	roundoff.

	* NEWS: note procrustes bug fix.

2000-02-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* minctracc/Main/Makefile.am (LDADD):
	* minctracc/Extra_progs/Makefile.am (LDADD):
	* mincblur/Makefile.am (LDADD): 
	* mincbbox/Makefile.am (LDADD): 
	* make_phantom/Makefile.am (LDADD): remove explicit -lvolume_io,
	etc; these are already included in @LIBDIRS@

2000-02-09  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* INSTALL: removed.  MNI_AutoReg now supports all the 
	GNU standard options, and can build outside the source
	hierarchy; so we rely on autogen.sh installing a generic
	INSTALL file before packaging the distribution.

	* configure.in: add ${prefix}/include/volume_io to includes
	if the directory exists; this is a hack that can be removed
	as soon as a fixed MINC is released.	

	* TESTING: 
	* README:
	* INSTALL.quick: updates.

2000-02-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* config.h.bot: renamed to acconfig.h.

	* acconfig.h: replaced test of HAVE_RECENT_VOLUME_IO with more
	specific feature tests.

2000-02-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing/Makefile.am (TEST_LIST): add animal.test, taken from
	minctracc/Testing/Makefile.

	* mincbbox/mincbbox.c (main): 
	* make_phantom/make_phantom.c (partial_elliptical, main): small
	fixes to placate "gcc -Wall", e.g. removed unused variables, add
	braces, declare main to return 'int'.

	* Proglib/print_error.c (print_error_and_line_num): removed
	fixed-length buffer.

Sun Jan 30 09:49:35 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* NEWS: note revamped build process; minctracc includes nonlinear.

Sat Jan 29 10:02:19 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Proglib/Makefile.am: 
	* minctracc/Makefile.am:
	* minctracc/Extra_progs/Makefile.am: list unused files as
	oddities.

Fri Jan 28 12:22:46 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add config.h.in.

	* autogen.sh: added.  Script to generate files not tracked in CVS.
	* README.CVS: added.

Fri Jan 28 10:39:10 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: revamped for automake.  Searching for required
	libraries (netcdf, minc, and volume_io) is completely redone using
	macros in acinclude.m4.  These macros are from the package
	smr_macros, available from http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software or
	ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/users/langston/autoconf.  These macros
	enable commandline arguments to configure, rather than relying on
	environment variables to specify the location of the libraries and
	their include files.  Checking the volume_io revision done using a
	C program, rather than relying on awk regular expressions.  All of
	the code to handle setting BINDIR, etc, via environment variables
	is gone; we rely on standard autoconf --prefix, --bindir and the
	like.  In detail: CONFIGDIR is set to $(sysconfdir)/mni_autoreg,
	and MODELDIR is set to $(libdir)/model, hence the defaults are the
	same as before, only the mechanism for non-default behaviour is
	changed.  Handling of "semi-standard C macros" such as DBL_MAX
	simplified by moving most of the logic to config.h.bot.

	* */Makefile.am:
	* acinclude.m4:
	* config.h.bot: added.  These are sources to generate the Makefiles,
	and config.h.

	* mincblur/mincblur.1:
	* minctracc/minctracc.1:
	* perl/autocrop.1:
	* perl/mritoself.1:
	* perl/mritotal.1: renamed from corresponding '.man1' files.

	* configure:
	* config.h.in:
	* */Makefile: removed.  These are built files, hence unnecessary
	to track in CVS.

	* Makefile.bottom:
	* Makefile.include.in: removed.  These are obsoleted by the
	automake-constructed makefiles.
	
	* VERSION: removed.  Version is now set in configure.in.
	* version.h.in: removed.  Version info moved into config.h.

	* AUTHORS: renamed from CONTACT.
	* COPYING: renamed from COPYRIGHT.
	* NEWS: renamed from CHANGES.  
	These renamings were done to adhere to GNU coding standards.

Fri Jan 28 00:35:41 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* perl/autocrop.in: add @LIBDIR@ to perl's search path.

	* perl/version.c: include config.h instead of ../version.h.

	* mincblur/fft.c: 
	* mincblur/apodize_data.c: include <config.h>, because definitions
	of public and private were moved there.  The defines used to be
	done on the compiler the command line.

	* ac_config_aux/config.guess:
	* ac_config_aux/config.sub:
	* ac_config_aux/install-sh: removed.  These scripts will be recreated
	by running 'automake --add-missing', so they need not be checked into
	the CVS repository.

	* */Makefile.am: new.
	
2000-01-27  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* VERSION: set to 0.98g.

	* Makefile (ALL_SUBDIRS): added mincbbox.  This directory was
 	manually added to the repository earlier today, by Louis.
  	Directories make_phantom and mincblur were manually updated at the
 	same time.

2000-01-25  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: removed definitions to /usr/local for $PREFIX since
	$PREFIX is defined by default in configure.

Wed Jan 19 22:23:46 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* ChangeLog:
	* */.cvsignore: new.
