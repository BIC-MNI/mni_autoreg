	* VERSION: set to 0.98g.

	* Makefile (ALL_SUBDIRS): added mincbbox.  This directory was
 	manually added to the repository earlier today, by Louis.
  	Directories make_phantom and mincblur were manually updated at the
 	same time.

2000-01-25  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: removed definitions to /usr/local for $PREFIX since
	$PREFIX is defined by default in configure.
