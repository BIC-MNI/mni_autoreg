	* Makefile.am: perl helper files (*.pl, *.pm) are installed into 
	the package libdir by default; this allows non-root to install 
	by simply setting the --prefix at configure time.

	* autocrop.in: 
	* mritoself.in:
	* mritotal.in: add package libdir to perl's search path, in order
	to find the *.pl and *.pm files.	

	* version.c: include <config.h> rather than "../version.h" to get
	the version strings.
