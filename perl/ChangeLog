	* Fixed bug in autocrop (thanks Ej Nikelski)

2005-08-03  Andrew L Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>

	* Removed internal version of mni_perllib
	* Updated all scripts to use MNI::Perl stuff
	* Added sensical -version options to all scripts

2003-06-12  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Startup.pm (SelfAnnounce): Remove "defined @argv", it is
	deprecated construct and perl warns noisily about it.

2001-02-16  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-local): Need "install-exec-local" rule
 	in both clauses of the conditional.  Otherwise, the Makefile may
 	be generated without the rule, which is referenced by other rules
 	(install-exec-am).  This upsets some makes.  Reported by Helmut
 	Lucht <Helmut.Lucht@pet.mpin-koeln.mpg.de>.

2000-05-25  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* mritotal.in (SetupNLFits): changed iterations, weight and
 	stiffness to have different values for optical flow and xcorr.

	(SetupFits): tested if optical flow was requested when doing
 	linear fits.  If so, then we default back to xcorr, only for the
 	linear fits.

2000-05-24  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* mritotal.in (Initialize): added optical flow to the list of accepted
	  objective functions for nonlinear registration.

2000-05-02  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* mritotal.in (pad_amounts): fix for hypothetical case where more
 	than two blurring kernels are specified.

2000-05-01  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* mritotal.in (IntensityBlur): properly remove the intermediate
 	file ${tmp_blur}_blur.mnc.

2000-04-06  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* removed all traces of `animal' from mritotal script.

2000-03-21  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* mritotal.in (CreateInfoText): removed statement that `mritotal'
	handles only linear fits.

2000-03-08  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* mritotal.1: document new options -nonlinear, -startlevel,
	-stoplevel.

2000-02-26  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* string_utilities.pl: new.  Needed for xfmtool.
	* Makefile.am (perllib_DATA): add string_utilities.pl.

2000-02-10  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* mritotal.in (perform_fit): treat `animal' as a synonym
	form `minctracc' (with -nonlinear added, later).

	* xfmtool.in: new.  Required for new mritotal.
	* Makefile.am (script_in, bin_SCRIPTS): add xfmtool.in, xfmtool

2000-02-09  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am (modeldir): set to pkgdatadir.

2000-02-08  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* mritotal.in: replaced by current development version of nlfit.

	* Makefile.am: make all generated files depend on the *.in files.

2000-02-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* version.c: include <stdio.h>

Sun Jan 30 09:28:03 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* build_perl_stuff: add --srcdir option to support srcdir !=
	builddir.

Fri Jan 28 11:06:45 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am: perl helper files (*.pl, *.pm) are installed into 
	the package libdir by default; this allows non-root to install 
	by simply setting the --prefix at configure time.

	* autocrop.in: 
	* mritoself.in:
	* mritotal.in: add package libdir to perl's search path, in order
	to find the *.pl and *.pm files.	

	* version.c: include <config.h> rather than "../version.h" to get
	the version strings.
