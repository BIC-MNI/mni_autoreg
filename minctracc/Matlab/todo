NEW MATCHING 
  use a different match criteria - use d^2 instead of abs(d) in
match.m 

NEW OPTIMIZATION
  use brute force for the first few iterations, afterwards, NR or
bisection methods should work reasonably well.  

Note that the objective function is not smooth all the way through the
domain where is is being estimated now. (However, most of the time is
is nicely parabolic, and always with a single minima!)  

What is the domain limit that should be used? After the first few
iterations, the minima seems to be within one half of the current
scale.

STOPPING CRITERIA:
  when do I stop iterating - should be when the smallest step
deformation applied at the current scale is some fraction of the
current scale ( or of the next scale, since it should be smaller than
the next scale as the next scale will have an upper limit.).

ITERATION STEP / SMOOTHING?
  how far along the desired direction should I step? Right now I step
0.3 of the required amount.  

  How much smoothing should there be between nodes?  There is a trade
off between a node, brought into position properly by the correlation
and haveing it pulled off by smoothing from another node that is not
tied down.

NEW RESAMPLING/FEATURES
  need to try to run the process using the original data, and use the
cubic spline fits to estimate the 2nd derivative.
