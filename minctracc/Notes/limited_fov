There are at least two problems with estimations of a deformation
vector based on similarity measures evaluated on a local neighbourhood
with a limited window size:

Self deformation:

their appears to be a certain small amount of self deformation
recovered for an object, even when it is matched to itself.  This is
true for both simplex and quadratic fitting objective functions.  Why?
Quantization errors? Sampling errors? Neighbourhood size?

With an ellipsoid phantom, 16fwhm, gradient magnitude features,
tri-linear interpolation, 8mm step, non-isotropic local smoothing:
	simplex opt:   .421 avg def mag in 3D
	quadratic opt: .425 avg def mag in 3D

Let us begin with a 1D example to see what the objective function should
look like when an ideal step edge with matched to itself.  The profile
of the gradient magnitude data extracted from the ideal step edge has
a gaussian shape (since the data is blurred with a gaussian before
derivation).  The shape of the local similarity function is a modulated
gaussian: the similarity function should be ideally an gaussian-shaped
autocorrelation function with a fwhm sqrt(2) times wider than the
blurring fwhm. This gaussian is then modulated by the cost function to
get the resulting objective function.  The shape of the obj function
should be a bit sharpened, since the cost function reduces its value
with distance from the center (zero deformation).

Since the actual cost function is a truncated cubic, the resulting obj
function is a gaussian * a truncated cubic.  In the


Quadratic: In the case of the quadratic fitting procedure, I assume
that the local objective function can be fit locally by a quadratic
function.  While this is true in the limiting case, as the diameter of
the neighbourhood approaches zero, it is not true for the size of the
neighbourhoods used to estimate the deformation vectors (diameter =
1.5fwhm recovered def).


Aperture problem:

The limited aperture permits the estimation of only the component of
the deformation that is perpendicular to the "edges" that appear in
the window.  In order to specify all components (x,y and z) of the
deformation vector, the hessian matrix of the local similarity
function _must_ be negative definite within the region defined by the
local window. (Note that I am identifying the similarity function
only, and not the objective function = similarity + cost; since the
cost function coerces the obj function to be negative definite.)

This means that a local translation will be correctly estimated, only
when the translation is perpendicular to the gradient edges in the
volume.

Most authors (including me) use additional constraints to regularize
the estimated vectors.  We assume that the deformation function is
smooth (ie is band limited) wrt the scale of recovery.  The components
of the deformation parallel to the gradient edges are given by the
smoothing term in the optimization process.
