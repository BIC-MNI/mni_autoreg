2000-05-16  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	removed nonfunctional call to qsort and replaced it with a
 	homegrown qs_list() to find the median ratio value when
 	normalizing intensities.
	(normalize_data_to_match_target): added a call to
 	set_feature_value_threshold() to automatically compute default
 	threshold values (if none are given on the command line) _before_
 	the computation of the volume-to-volume intensity normalization
 	factor.

2000-05-12  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Extra_progs/xfm2param.c: handle all types of
	transformations without a core dump.

2000-05-08  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	added a dummy change to test CVS

2000-05-05  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c: (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	added new function to be able to normalize the intensity values of
 	the source to the target volume when doing optic flow.

	* Optimize/optimize.c: (optimize_non_linear_transformation): call
        normalize_data_to_match_target() if using optical flow in the
        nonlinear registration process to normalize the intensities of the
        source volue to fit those in the target volume   

2000-04-05  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/super_sample_def.c
	(interpolate_super_sampled_data_by2): moved main body of function
	into `interpolate_super_sampled_data_by2_dim3' in order to avoid
	having to branch around an enormous amount of code, as GCC on IRIX
	5.3 couldn't handle it.

2000-03-16  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Volume/interpolation.c (point_not_masked,
	voxel_point_not_masked): simplified the code.

	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c: declare SX, SY, SZ static.  Re-enable
	dumping of per-iteration warps, when debugging and verbose == 3.

2000-03-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* */*: ensure all functions properly prototyped.  Compiles cleanly
	(on linux) using CFLAGS='-Dlint -Wall -Wpointer-arith
	-Wstrict-prototypes'.

	* Include/super_saple_def.h:
	* Include/interpolation.h: 
	* Include/init_lattice.h: new.  Prototype public functions for
	corresponding C file.
	
	* Extra_progs/zscore_vol.c:
	* Extra_progs/volume_cog.c: 
	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.c:
	* Extra_progs/check_scale.c: 
	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c:
	* Optimize/obj_fn_mutual_info.c:
	* Optimize/objectives.c:
	* Optimize/vox_space.c: 
	* Optimize/def_obj_functions.c (similarity_fn): remove
	declarations of unused variables.

	* Include/quad_max_fit.h: removed useless `static' declarations.

	* Optimize/deform_support.c (tricubic_slice_interpolant): 
	* Numerical/quad_max_fit.c (get_disp_from_positive_semidefinite):
	removed; functions were defined but not used.

2000-03-08  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Doc/minctracc.doc: removed; appears to be old version of Doc/doc.
	* Makefile.am: change to docs.

2000-03-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am: don't advertise the oddities.

2000-03-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/xcorr_vol.c (main): correct usage output.

2000-02-19  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.c (main): 
	* Main/minctracc.c (main): use history_string() to generate
	history.

2000-02-15  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: rename function `test' to
 	`check_transform', since the former is restricted on IRIX 6.5 sh;
 	don't use ! to negate command status (breaks on IRIX 5.3).

2000-02-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/Makefile.am (TESTS): add param2xfm.tests.
	(check_PROGRAMS): add cmpxfm.

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: new.  Test param2xfm by comparing
	output to known answer.

	* Extra_progs/cmpxfm.c: new.  Compare two `linear' transforms; exit
	with zero if they are identical to within a specified tolerance.

	* Extra_progs/xcorr_vol.c (main): set return type to 'int'.

2000-02-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/constants.h (TRANS_LSQ): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES define.
	This set of transformations is supposed to be the same as LSQ7.
	However, in a couple of places (Optimize/optimize.c) only
	TRANS_LSQ7 was being checked for.  The result was that
	PROCRUSTES's 7th parameter was the x-scale, rather than the global
	scale.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (optimize_linear_transformation, measure_fit): 
	* Main/make_matlab_data_file.c (make_matlab_data_file): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES case.

	* Include/minctracc.h (main_args): default transform type is LSQ7.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (in_limits): add inline qualifier.

2000-02-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/extras.c (report_time): 
	* Numerical/default_def.c (resample_the_deformation_field): 
	* Volume/init_lattice.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): 
	* Extra_progs/reversedef.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): replaced
	test of HAVE_RECENT_VOLUME_IO with more specific feature tests.

2000-02-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing: removed.  Folded extra test for "animal" into
	../Testing.

Fri Jan 28 16:44:19 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/globals.h (argTable): remove ifdef NONLINEAR_RELEASE.
