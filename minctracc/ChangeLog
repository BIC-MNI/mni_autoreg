	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: rename function `test' to
 	`check_transform', since the former is restricted on IRIX 6.5 sh;
 	don't use ! to negate command status (breaks on IRIX 5.3).

2000-02-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/Makefile.am (TESTS): add param2xfm.tests.
	(check_PROGRAMS): add cmpxfm.

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: new.  Test param2xfm by comparing
	output to known answer.

	* Extra_progs/cmpxfm.c: new.  Compare two `linear' transforms; exit
	with zero if they are identical to within a specified tolerance.

	* Extra_progs/xcorr_vol.c (main): set return type to 'int'.

	* Include/constants.h (TRANS_LSQ): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES define.
	This set of transformations is supposed to be the same as LSQ7.
	However, in a couple of places (Optimize/optimize.c) only
	TRANS_LSQ7 was being checked for.  The result was that
	PROCRUSTES's 7th parameter was the x-scale, rather than the global
	scale.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (optimize_linear_transformation, measure_fit): 
	* Main/make_matlab_data_file.c (make_matlab_data_file): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES case.

	* Include/minctracc.h (main_args): default transform type is LSQ7.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (in_limits): add inline qualifier.

	* Optimize/extras.c (report_time): 
	* Numerical/default_def.c (resample_the_deformation_field): 
	* Volume/init_lattice.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): 
	* Extra_progs/reversedef.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): replaced
	test of HAVE_RECENT_VOLUME_IO with more specific feature tests.

2000-02-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing: removed.  Folded extra test for "animal" into
	../Testing.

	* Include/globals.h (argTable): remove ifdef NONLINEAR_RELEASE.
