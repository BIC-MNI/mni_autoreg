2003-02-03  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/sub_lattice.c (go_get_samples_with_offset): 
	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c (build_lattices): 
	* Optimize/switch_obj_func.c: Add support for NONLIN_CORRCOEFF
	and NONLIN_SQDIFF.

	* Include/globals.h (argTable): Change -nonlinear to ARGV_FUNC.

	* Include/minctracc.h: 
	* Main/minctracc.c (get_nonlinear_objective): New function to 
	handle "-nonlinear".

	* Include/constants.h: Add NONLIN_CORRCOEFF and NONLIN_SQDIFF.

	* Optimize/optimize.c: Declare normalize_data_to_match_target().

	* Include/quaternion.h: Do not declare static function
	normalize_quat() in public header.

	* Makefile.am (includes): Add quaternion.h.

2002-10-25  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/Makefile.am (LDADD): Put libminctracc_optimize.a after
	libminctracc_numerical.a, to satisfy dependencies of the latter.

2002-08-09  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/sub_lattice.c (go_get_samples_with_offset): Fix error
	message.

2001-01-17  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	fixed a memory leak, where I used copy_volume_definition, when I
 	thought that this command only returned a volume ehader structure
 	(without actual volumetric data).  I've changed it to
 	copy_volume_definition_no_alloc, and I've done a delete_volume()
 	at the end of the block.  No more leak (at least for here).

2000-05-23  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	fixed the index ordering for i,j,k when normalizing the
 	intensities of the source volume. (they were backwards!)

2000-05-16  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Optimize/optimize.c (optimize_non_linear_transformation):
 	changed the call to normalize_data_to_match_target() so that all
 	feature volume pairs are normalized (instead of the only the main
 	(zeroeth) volume pair).

	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c (do_non_linear_optimization): removed a
 	whole looping section that was conditional on a FALSE, since it is
 	no longer needed.

	Also, added a call to normalize_data_to_match_target() at the
 	bottom of the main loop for all feature volumes, so that all
 	volume pairs that use optical flow get the intensity normalization
 	procedure at each iteration (since the normalization procedure is
 	based the best guess for the current transformation.)

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	removed nonfunctional call to qsort and replaced it with a
 	homegrown qs_list() to find the median ratio value when
 	normalizing intensities.
	(normalize_data_to_match_target): added a call to
 	set_feature_value_threshold() to automatically compute default
 	threshold values (if none are given on the command line) _before_
 	the computation of the volume-to-volume intensity normalization
 	factor.
	(normalize_data_to_match_target): changed the call to
 	set_feature_value_threshold() so that it no longer changes the
 	globals thresholds, and only sets temporary threshold values (like
 	it is supposed to do) for use within the procedure.
	

2000-05-12  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Extra_progs/xfm2param.c: handle all types of
	transformations without a core dump.

2000-05-08  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	added a dummy change to test CVS

2000-05-05  Louis COLLINS  <louis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Volume/volume_functions.c: (normalize_data_to_match_target):
 	added new function to be able to normalize the intensity values of
 	the source to the target volume when doing optic flow.

	* Optimize/optimize.c: (optimize_non_linear_transformation): call
        normalize_data_to_match_target() if using optical flow in the
        nonlinear registration process to normalize the intensities of the
        source volue to fit those in the target volume   

2000-04-05  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/super_sample_def.c
	(interpolate_super_sampled_data_by2): moved main body of function
	into `interpolate_super_sampled_data_by2_dim3' in order to avoid
	having to branch around an enormous amount of code, as GCC on IRIX
	5.3 couldn't handle it.

2000-03-16  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Volume/interpolation.c (point_not_masked,
	voxel_point_not_masked): simplified the code.

	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c: declare SX, SY, SZ static.  Re-enable
	dumping of per-iteration warps, when debugging and verbose == 3.

2000-03-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* */*: ensure all functions properly prototyped.  Compiles cleanly
	(on linux) using CFLAGS='-Dlint -Wall -Wpointer-arith
	-Wstrict-prototypes'.

	* Include/super_saple_def.h:
	* Include/interpolation.h: 
	* Include/init_lattice.h: new.  Prototype public functions for
	corresponding C file.
	
	* Extra_progs/zscore_vol.c:
	* Extra_progs/volume_cog.c: 
	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.c:
	* Extra_progs/check_scale.c: 
	* Optimize/do_nonlinear.c:
	* Optimize/obj_fn_mutual_info.c:
	* Optimize/objectives.c:
	* Optimize/vox_space.c: 
	* Optimize/def_obj_functions.c (similarity_fn): remove
	declarations of unused variables.

	* Include/quad_max_fit.h: removed useless `static' declarations.

	* Optimize/deform_support.c (tricubic_slice_interpolant): 
	* Numerical/quad_max_fit.c (get_disp_from_positive_semidefinite):
	removed; functions were defined but not used.

2000-03-08  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Doc/minctracc.doc: removed; appears to be old version of Doc/doc.
	* Makefile.am: change to docs.

2000-03-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am: don't advertise the oddities.

2000-03-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/xcorr_vol.c (main): correct usage output.

2000-02-19  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.c (main): 
	* Main/minctracc.c (main): use history_string() to generate
	history.

2000-02-15  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: rename function `test' to
 	`check_transform', since the former is restricted on IRIX 6.5 sh;
 	don't use ! to negate command status (breaks on IRIX 5.3).

2000-02-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Extra_progs/Makefile.am (TESTS): add param2xfm.tests.
	(check_PROGRAMS): add cmpxfm.

	* Extra_progs/param2xfm.tests: new.  Test param2xfm by comparing
	output to known answer.

	* Extra_progs/cmpxfm.c: new.  Compare two `linear' transforms; exit
	with zero if they are identical to within a specified tolerance.

	* Extra_progs/xcorr_vol.c (main): set return type to 'int'.

2000-02-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/constants.h (TRANS_LSQ): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES define.
	This set of transformations is supposed to be the same as LSQ7.
	However, in a couple of places (Optimize/optimize.c) only
	TRANS_LSQ7 was being checked for.  The result was that
	PROCRUSTES's 7th parameter was the x-scale, rather than the global
	scale.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (optimize_linear_transformation, measure_fit): 
	* Main/make_matlab_data_file.c (make_matlab_data_file): remove TRANS_PROCRUSTES case.

	* Include/minctracc.h (main_args): default transform type is LSQ7.

	* Optimize/optimize.c (in_limits): add inline qualifier.

2000-02-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Optimize/extras.c (report_time): 
	* Numerical/default_def.c (resample_the_deformation_field): 
	* Volume/init_lattice.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): 
	* Extra_progs/reversedef.c (get_volume_XYZV_indices): replaced
	test of HAVE_RECENT_VOLUME_IO with more specific feature tests.

2000-02-02  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Testing: removed.  Folded extra test for "animal" into
	../Testing.

Fri Jan 28 16:44:19 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/globals.h (argTable): remove ifdef NONLINEAR_RELEASE.
