quadratic fitting - 
       -what are the weighting functions to ensure local concavity
	(positive jacobian?)
       -are these weightings necessary?
       -when using quadratic fitting, the def vecs returned are
	bounded by the step size. Bigger deforamtions are recoverable
	only with multiple iterations.  Therefore, I have to determine
	the scale for the data wrt the scale of the deformation.
       -Why does a single 2D direct iteration recover larger (and thus
	better) warps?  this must be do to the cost function.

super sampling of the data set - now seems to take a good fraction of
the time required to estimate the deformation field - this does not
seem to be a good thing.  How can I make the subsampling faster?

what are the weights/parameter selections for -weight, -similar,
-stiff, -iterations ?



I assume isotropic voxels for the feature volumes in the optimization
- should mention this in doc, or test in code.

How can I guarentee a monotonically decreasing error function?

	in the estimation of the non-linear deformation, I should
	always be able to increase the correlation between two
	volumes, given more iterations (the error should always be
	diminishing).  this implies a balence between the amount of 
	smoothing and the weight given to each deformation vector at
	each iteration. How is the balence to be determined?

Can I speed up the algorithm by doing fits only where the measure of
local correlation says I should - ie skip the estimation of the def
vector where correlation is already high?

Directional smoothing - smooth in direction of uncertainty.

Use projections - try to see how the projections can be incorporated
into the algorithm for speed increase.

	test projection code - why does it not give values comparable
	to the sub-lattice correlation?

	compare correlation values between real neighbourhood corr and
	projection data.

-------------------------------------


              LINEAR:

make sure that lsq3,6,9,10,12 all work!

make sure that -measure works when using a subject mask.


		NON-LINEAR:

-------------------------------------------------------------
0) 
-------------------------------------------------------------
0) neighberhoos smoothing (averaging) before estimation of
deformation?  how to do when 3D correlation?

-------------------------------------------------------------
0) deformation cost does not seem to behave properly.... check it with
matlab?  

-------------------------------------------------------------
0) cost function must be worked out... right now, -similar 0.95
weighting is too high - should change the function to have weight at 0.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------
0)  speed up - check for last nodes moved, see if their nieghbourhood
needs to be redone.

-------------------------------------------------------------
0) new features in non-linear matching? radial vs tangential matching

-------------------------------------------------------------
0) check estimatation of displacement at edges of data set. I was
setting them to zero, however, maybe they should be set to -DBL_MAX
and I should check for that in match.c


-------------------------------------------------------------
0) need to set up some kind of hierarchy of gradient edges that are to
be matched.   


-------------------------------------------------------------
1) need to test against different phantoms.  Maybe need a program to
create phantoms easily.  See Olivier and Yilong.

-------------------------------------------------------------
2) what happens when the node to be estimated falls along a ridge line
(in one data set or the other?)  The direction of maximum gradient
can or cannot be estimated at these points?

where is the gradient pointing?

is there a way to detect it, and avoid it, thus getting the value by
smoothing from the neighbours.

-------------------------------------------------------------
3) for the deformation volume returned at the end of processing, some
voxels appear to be spurious - results in one of the three deformation
volumes...

could be due to:
	-errors in estimation of gradient direction.
	-quantization error in gradient magnitude OR
	-quantization error in intensity magnitude.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4) need a def_invert program to invert and store the inverted
transformation.  (this will make the resampling faster) - need to
check to see if INVERSE_FLAG is set,stored, or used for user
transforms.

note that the inverted deformation volume is defined on
(approximatedly) the same volume as the forward deformation, so that
the inverted deformation should be easy to create.

Actually, the inverted deformation is defined on a volume that is
slightly larger (by the min/max value stored in the volume).

-------------------------------------------------------------
5) need to have a def_concat to concatenate a group of non-linear
transformations - when concatenated, we should get a bit of a speed up
in the resample process both in minctracc and in mincresample. 

------------------------------------------------------------
6) should probably pre-blur the MRI data, since there is an inherent blur
within the target MRI average volume.

-------------------------------------------------------------
7) I must guarantee that the optimization process stays in the global
minima at each step. I must not introduce false-matches at one scale,
since they will be maintained throughout the deformation process.
This might be achieved using stiffness parameters from a physical model ...

-------------------------------------------------------------
8) Physical model:  

  springs between nodes to control distance to move between structures 
+ stiffness parameters at the node

A bit like a rubber jack, where each of the arms can be stretched and
bent with respect to each other.

           1   6  
           #  #              N - node under consideration
           | /               # - 6-neighbours of N
           |/ 
      3#---N---#4            a) constraint on distance between N and #
          /|                 b) constraint on angle <#N# for each of the
         / |                    six angles.  <1N2 or <1N4 to be used?
        #  #                    <1N2 should be ~= 180'
       5   2                    <1N4 should be ~= 90'



-------------------------------------------------------------
when getting points from the target volume, I should use the current
total deformation to map the current points through the non-linear
deformation.  This way, the data being matched is much more realistic
- in the sense the warped source is truly being matched to the  target
- instead of warping only the node itself (this will also warp the
neighbourhood!).
 



================================================================
LINEAR MINCTRACC:


in ssc - I have to model the difference in intensity between the
two volumes: the two volumes have to have the same mean (and std)
for the algorithm to be efficient.  Otherwise, It is only fitting 
background volume between the two data sets.

------------------------------------
parameter equivalence:

woods uses 55.84 mm/radian to account for different units when comparing
derivitives.

woods uses 0.0057/mm and 0.005/radian for threshold values on derivitives.

---------------------

grep for fill_value in *c
   is fill_value a voxel value?
   if so, should it be = -1 if there is no fill value in the minc file?
----------------------


if args.obj_function == vr_objective,
  force volume read to be bytes or shorts, all slices normalized to the same max/min.
  so that the segmentation can be done on voxel values!

-------------------------------------------------------------
9) Interpolation mode tied to volume of data:

should see (local_macros) if there is a possibility to tie cubic
interpolation to the deformation model.... maybe directly in
transformations.c 

modified transformations.c to use tri-cubic interpolation at all
times!

-------------------------------------------------------------
* there seems to be some trouble when stepping from one scale to the
next.   This may be due to resampling (interpolating) on the
deformation field.  see point 9 below.

Both mincresample and minctracc are using tri-cubic interpolation for
the non-linear deformation volumes.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I need to remove the possibility of edge effects, both from the volume
of data and the deformation field.

for the volume of data: must make sure that there is a sufficient
`band' around the edge of the data so that there is no aliasing of the
gradients (done). 

for the deformation field: must create a band of data, at least as
wide as the current step size.  (two times the current step would
probably be safest!). (done - in build_default_def in transformations.c)
