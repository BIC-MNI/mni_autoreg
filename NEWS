Release 0.99.6
--------------
* Free memory after usage in mincblur.
* fixed one bug in apodize_data.c for ABS(step) in one direction
* now use VIO_X, VIO_Y, VIO_Z (no more X, Y, Z) in mincblur and
  make it invariant to dimension order

Release 0.99.5
--------------

* input source and volumes are read as DOUBLES.  
* deformation fields are created and manipulated as DOUBLES.
	
Release 0.99.4
--------------

* added -nmi option (normalized mutual information) as an objective
  function for linear registration.
* modeldir is now $prefix/share/mni-models
* fixed a bug for offsets in minctracc/Volume/init_lattice.c
* free memory after usage in minctracc
* file compression (minc2) disabled for temporary files in make_model
* fixed bug in mritoself with same file names in different directories

Release 0.99.3
--------------

* new release to compile on ia64

Release 0.99.2
--------------

* fixed a bug in mritoself and mritotal when piping output to STDOUT

Release 0.99.1
--------------

* fixed a bug in autocrop regarding split_path

Release 0.98v
-------------

* added vladimir fonovs changes to xfmtool to allow .gz grid files


Release 0.98u
-------------

* removed perl libraries that are now part of mni_perllib
* removed c libraries that are now part of MINC proper

Release 0.98t
-------------

* 30% speed increase due to changes in nonlinear fitting code
* Corrected masking in sub-lattice (Patricia Le Nezet and Irina Kezele)


Release 0.98s
-------------

* Removed malloc.h from mincblur to assist build on OSX


Release 0.98r
-------------

* Fixed COV bug (lenezet)
* Fixed make check bug with direction cosines
* added epm-header.in for binary package building


Release 0.98q
-------------

* Removed all reference to public and private syntatic sugar
    private has been replaced with static.  This has caused
	erratic build problems in the past.  Let's see if things
	are better now.
* Removed most Keyword Substitutions in perl programs in favour
    of the perl module FindBin::Bin this module is part of the
	base perl distribution


Release 0.98p
-------------

* Fixed problems with Direction cosines of input volumes
* Changed from volume_stats to mincstats in minc_utilities.pl
   this will mean that we no longer have a dependency on N3.Z


Release 0.98j
-------------

* Build process changed: third-party libraries will no longer be
  searched for in /usr/local and ${prefix} by default.  Specify
  the directories to search using --with-build-path.


Release 0.98i
-------------

This is a bug-fix release; no user-visible changes.


Release 0.98h
-------------

* mritotal handles nonlinear as well as linear fitting.
* Build process revamped: supports non source-directory builds; no
  environment variables are required to specify library locations.
* Fixed bug that caused PROCRUSTES transformations to optimize only
  the x-scale, rather than a global scale (as LSQ7 does).
* Generated files contain the long version string in their comment section.


Release 0.98g
-------------

* Minctracc is built with both linear and non-linear registration.


Release 0.98f
-------------

* version 0.98e did not give the same registration results as 0.98d when
  using masks due to an oversight in the voxel coordinate manipulation
  in the mask volumes - an important problem for using mritotal.  
  This has been corrected in 0.98f.


Release 0.98e
-------------

* feature volumes are supported to be able to register sets (like T1, T2 and
  classified data) of volumes from a source data set to match corresponding
  features of a target.
* the minctracc registration engine is approximately 2.5 times faster for
  resampling data during evaluation of the optimization function.  This
  results in an overall reduction in execution time by a factor of 2.


Release 0.98
------------

* added mritoself to list of programs to install (in perl/Makefile)
* slight tweak to test of compiler's ANSIness in configure script
* fixed some subtle but important bugs in mritotal, autocrop, and mritoself
* more enhancements to the Perl libraries
* removed an unused option (-Lvv) from mincblur's argument table
* removed ParseArgs module from the distribution -- Getopt::Tabular 
  (available separately) is now required
* changed mritotal's algorithm for trimming volumes after blurring
* added '-bbox' feature to autocrop
bug fixes:
release 0.98b, 0.98c: fixed two bugs in mritoself


Release 0.97
------------

* fixed those bugs in mritotal
* enhanced configure script for portability and flexibility
* added the TESTING document to explain testing the package in detail


Release 0.96
------------

* inexplicable jump of four micro-versions instead of one
* introduced some buggy features in mritotal


Release 0.92
------------

* the implementation of the mutual information objective function in
  minctracc has been greatly improved
* many portability problems have been fixed
* some real bugs (particularly in mincblur) have been fixed
* most of the Perl libraries have been greatly updated to take
  better advantage of Perl 5
* added -blur/-noblur and -firstobj options to mritotal (experimental --
  not used by any of the standard fitting procedures)


Release 0.91
------------

Lost in the mists of time...


Release 0.9
-----------

First public release.
