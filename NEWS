CHANGES to the MNI_AutoReg package...

Release 0.98j
-------------

* Build process changed: third-party libraries will no longer be
  searched for in /usr/local and ${prefix} by default.  Specify
  the directories to search using --with-build-path.


Release 0.98i
-------------

This is a bug-fix release; no user-visible changes.


Release 0.98h
-------------

* mritotal handles nonlinear as well as linear fitting.
* Build process revamped: supports non source-directory builds; no
  environment variables are required to specify library locations.
* Fixed bug that caused PROCRUSTES transformations to optimize only
  the x-scale, rather than a global scale (as LSQ7 does).
* Generated files contain the long version string in their comment section.


Release 0.98g
-------------

* Minctracc is built with both linear and non-linear registration.


Release 0.98f
-------------

* version 0.98e did not give the same registration results as 0.98d when
  using masks due to an oversight in the voxel coordinate manipulation
  in the mask volumes - an important problem for using mritotal.  
  This has been corrected in 0.98f.


Release 0.98e
-------------

* feature volumes are supported to be able to register sets (like T1, T2 and
  classified data) of volumes from a source data set to match corresponding
  features of a target.
* the minctracc registration engine is approximately 2.5 times faster for
  resampling data during evaluation of the optimization function.  This
  results in an overall reduction in execution time by a factor of 2.


Release 0.98
------------

* added mritoself to list of programs to install (in perl/Makefile)
* slight tweak to test of compiler's ANSIness in configure script
* fixed some subtle but important bugs in mritotal, autocrop, and mritoself
* more enhancements to the Perl libraries
* removed an unused option (-Lvv) from mincblur's argument table
* removed ParseArgs module from the distribution -- Getopt::Tabular 
  (available separately) is now required
* changed mritotal's algorithm for trimming volumes after blurring
* added '-bbox' feature to autocrop
bug fixes:
release 0.98b, 0.98c: fixed two bugs in mritoself


Release 0.97
------------

* fixed those bugs in mritotal
* enhanced configure script for portability and flexibility
* added the TESTING document to explain testing the package in detail


Release 0.96
------------

* inexplicable jump of four micro-versions instead of one
* introduced some buggy features in mritotal


Release 0.92
------------

* the implementation of the mutual information objective function in
  minctracc has been greatly improved
* many portability problems have been fixed
* some real bugs (particularly in mincblur) have been fixed
* most of the Perl libraries have been greatly updated to take
  better advantage of Perl 5
* added -blur/-noblur and -firstobj options to mritotal (experimental --
  not used by any of the standard fitting procedures)


Release 0.91
------------

Lost in the mists of time...


Release 0.9
-----------

First public release.
